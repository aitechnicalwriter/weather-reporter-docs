# Case Study: Documentation Refactor for Weather Reporter

**Project Overview**
I identified an unmaintained, archived Python script within a [beginner projects repository](https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/projects/Weather) and developed a complete technical documentation set to make it production-ready.

**The Challenge**
The original project lacked setup instructions, dependency management, and technical explanations of its API logic. This made the script difficult for new developers to use or contribute to effectively.

**My Solution**
I performed a context retrieval and logic synthesis of the code to create:

* **A Standardized README**: Included a "Quick Start" guide and feature breakdown.
* **Dependency Management**: Created a `requirements.txt` to enable one-command environment setup.
* **Technical API Reference**: Documented the JSON parsing paths and the mathematical conversion from Kelvin to Celsius ().
* **Contribution Guidelines**: Established a professional workflow for theoretical feature enhancements like unit toggling and forecast integration.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**

* Technical writing for developers (Markdown & LaTeX).
* Code analysis (Python, JSON parsing).
* Environment management (venv & pip).
